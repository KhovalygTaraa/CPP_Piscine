# CPP_Piscine
This is C++ mini projects. Their goal is introduction to C++ language. In these projects we can't use 
external libraries, just standard C++98 library. Also we can't use any containers and <algorithm>.

ex01 - Class, member functions, basics.

### CPP_Module01
ex00 - Memory allocation in C++.
ex01 - Memory allocation in C++, pointers.
