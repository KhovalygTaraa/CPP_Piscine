# CPP_Piscine
This is C++ mini projects. Their goal is introduction to C++ language. In these projects we can't use 
external libraries, just standard C++98 library. Also we can't use any containers and <algorithm>.

### CPP_Module00
1. ex00 - Namespace, stdio stream.
2. ex01 - Class, member functions, basics.

### CPP_Module01
1. ex00 - Memory allocation in C++.
2. ex01 - Memory allocation in C++, pointers.
3. ex02 - Memory allocation in C++, pointers.
4. ex03 - Memory allocation in C++, pointers.
5. ex04 - References, pointers.
6. ex05 - References, pointers.
7. ex06 - References, pointers, encapsulation.
8. ex07 - File streams.

### CPP_Module02
1. ex00 - Operators overload, canonical classes.
